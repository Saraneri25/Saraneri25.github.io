## Discover the U-GO team.
{{< /lead >}}

Our team is made up of students from the Academy of Fine Arts in Reggio Calabria of the second year of *New Art Technologies*, the third year of *Comics and Illustration* and the third year of *Graphic Art*. 

The creation of U-GO was developed during the course of *Interactive Systems* with professor Giacomo Tufano. 

For the development of the game, in order to optimize work and make the best use of different skills, the team was divided into specialized groups, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the project.
