Chiara, a student of the academy, touches the case in which Hugo was stored, causing it to fall. Annoyed, the elf decides to trap the professors inside of magic cases and to tear up the whole academy. 

The player is a student who has the task of freeing professors, solving puzzles, passing tests and collecting magic objects to unlock the cases.
